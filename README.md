# WebCoursera

## Introduction
We have developed an E-learning platform named WebCoursera, which offers a list of courses. Currently, the following courses are offered on our website :
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- JAVA
- AJAX
- PYTHON
  
In each course page , course recordings offered are categorized on the basis of duration, i.e. short, medium and long . Apart from recordings, the courses also offer reference materials.  

Dedicated, validation incorporated, and feature rich signup, login and dedicated profile pages for individual users, which show the course progress for the corresponding user, are included along with the platform. All passwords are stored in databases securely as output of their corresponding hash function so that even in case of database theft, the hacker can not directly view the original password.

A separate admin authentication has been added wherein the administrator can view the registered users and courses in a sortable table view and also write their own sql query.
